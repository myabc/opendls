<h3>Quick Search</h3>

<p class="bodyText">
One can put in an exact keyword or title to begin a search.
You will use this search when you are looking for a broad topic such as "birds," a specific title such as "Whooping Crane," an alternative title such as "Grus americana."
</p>

<ul>
<li>
If you are searching by creator then you must use the advanced search option (see below).
</li>

<li>The system is not case sensitive so you may use either lower or upper case.</li>
<li>Punctuation of any kind is not recognized.</li>

<li>
One way to really enhance your quick search is to use an asterisk * as a wild card. <br />
For example, if you use the asterisk with "fish" to make "fish*" then you will not only pick up all fish, but also fishes, fisheries, fishing within the title, subject and description field.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Advanced Search</h3>

<p class="bodyText">You have three different options when you do an advanced search:

<ul>
 <li>Exact Search</li>
 <li>Boolean Search</li>
 <li>Smart Search</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h4>Exact Search</h4>

<p class="bodyText">
Selecting an exact search is like using the simple search with an exact term or keyword and sorting that by either date, resource type, or library.
You may also decide to search the title, alternative title, subject, description, creator and then further refine those terms by date, resource type and/or library.</p>

<p class="bodyText">
For example, you may search for Arctic fox still images by a photographer named Scheffer. You would put the term "Arctic fox" in the quick search box, specify "still image" as the resource type and then scroll down the page to put in the creator's name "Scheffer"</p>

<h4>Boolean Search</h4>

<p class="bodyText">
Selecting a boolean search will enable you to use the following operators:

<ul>
 <li>and</li>
 <li>or</li>
 <li>not</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class="bodyText">
You can string together keywords and other terms found in the title, description and creator fields
to refine your search to include for example "fox not kits" or as other examples might include

<ul>
 <li><strong>fox and (kit* not gray)</strong> -	All fox kit images except gray fox</li>
 <li><strong>arctic fox and kit*</strong> - All Arctic fox kit images</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class="bodyText"><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> Use parentheses ( ) around all search terms when more than one term is used with your main keyword.</p>

<h4>Smart Search</h4>

<p class="bodyText">
You can use a series of words together or even a complete sentence that will match words and terms used in all fields.  If you select this option you will undoubtedly get many hits.</p>

<p class="bodyText">
For example:<br />
<blockquote>You may type in: "I am looking for Arctic fox still images by a photographer named Scheffer"</blockquote></p>

<p class="bodyText">
The database will pick up 46 hits because all significant words will be included in the results sich as "Arctic," "fox," "photographer," and "Scheffer."  This is useful for browsing larger file selections which might be relevant. It also gives the searcher a free text query which is easier to initiate. However, keep in mind that your results will not be as specific or exact and it may take more time to cull through them.</p>

<p class="bodyText">Likewise, you may put in the terms "arctic fox* scheffer" and pull up only those Arctic fox images photographed by Scheffer.</p>
